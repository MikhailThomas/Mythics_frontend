    <p>Are you passionate about wildlife conservation? Do you love a good excuse to travel? With so many depressing news stories about wildlife poaching we felt inspired to put together a list of some very worthwhile sanctuaries around the world.
</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>These sanctuaries are doing amazing work in helping, protecting and caring for endangered, abused and injured animals all around the globe.

These places offer a safe haven for wildlife and are a lot more ethical than zoos, you will have your faith restored in humanity knowing these places exist and it will be a special experience visiting in person.

Sometimes you might need to make a booking in advance, please check the organisations website for more information. If you would like to do something more than just visiting for a day, some sanctuaries offer more hands on experiences where you can volunteer. You might also want to consider buying wildlife conservation jewelry if you aren't able to go overseas to help.

View our list of incredible sanctuaries making a real difference to the lives of wildlife in Europe, North America, Latin America, Asia, Africa & Australasia below.

    <p>The Sheldrick Wildlife Trust is based in Nairobi, Kenya, with a field headquarters bordering Tsavo East National Park.

    <p>We work across Kenya to secure safe havens for wildlife. We not only work to protect elephants and rhinos, but entire ecosystems and the diverse flora and fauna sustained in these places of stunning natural beauty.

<div>
    <p>Flora and fauna in Kenya face a myriad of challenges that threaten their long term future. Few ecosystems still exist where the impact of human activity has not been felt, threatening biodiversity and the long term survival of many species.

    <p>We protect a number of threatened and endangered species across Kenya including black and white rhinos, as well as iconic animals like African elephants. By protecting keystone species, we ensure a plethora of other animals and ecosystems continue to survive and, more importantly, thrive.
